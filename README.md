# Functional, structural and mutation testing #

## Project Specifications ##

1. Create a software program  

The ```binary_heap.py``` file contains an algorithm to construct/extract a Binary Heap  
based on a list of values.

2. Generate test data  

Use   
* equivalence partitioning,   
* boundary value analysis,   
* category partitioning methods to generate data.

3. Compute program complexity  
Using [McCabe formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity) compute the program complexity.

4. Write Tests

5. Generate mutations
