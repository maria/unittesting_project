  *Valid:
  a, b, c > 0 && a, b, c <= 20
    
  *Invalid:
  a, b, c > 20, a, b, c <= 0

  *Based on theÂ treatment to data = handling of data
    1.1. a, b, c such that the triangle is equilateral
    1.2. a, b, c such that the triangle is isosceles
    1.3. a, b, c such that the triangle is scalene
    1.4. a, b, c such that it's not a triangle

  *Based on input
    1.5. a = b = c
    1.6. a = b, a <> c
    1.7. a = c, a <> b
    1.8. b = c, a <> b
    1.9. a <> b, a <> c, b <> c

  *Based on triangle property
    1.10. a, b, c such that a >= b + c
    1.11. a, b, c such that b >= a + c
    1.12. a, b, c such that c >= a + b
